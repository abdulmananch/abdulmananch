## Hi, I'm Abdul Manan

Frontend web developer who got into coding because biology is boring 😴
Experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Vue.js. 
Committed to bringing my creative and technical skills to a busy team in a startup or tech-forward company. 

In addition to coding, I’m a passionate photographer & videographer, occasionally creating content for YouTube to showcase these talents. 
If you’re hiring, let’s chat!”
